# 📘 Month 1: Python Basics & Data Manipulation

Welcome to my Month 1 learning journey in Python! This repository includes *Hands-On Tasks* and *Client Projects* from 4 weekly modules. All theoretical notes are documented separately in a Word file.

This internship is part of **The Developer Arena Program**, where I’m building strong foundations in Python, data handling, and real-world problem-solving. It’s directly aligned with my goal of becoming a **Data Science Engineer** 👨‍💻.

## 🌱 About Me & This Internship Journey

🚀 I’m currently pursuing training under **The Developer Arena Internship**, where I aim to:

- Master core Python programming
- Apply real-world data manipulation techniques
- Create project-based solutions using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
- Build a strong portfolio for Data Science and AI roles

This project is one of many stepping stones on my path toward becoming a skilled **AI + Data Science Engineer**, blending backend logic with smart visualizations!
